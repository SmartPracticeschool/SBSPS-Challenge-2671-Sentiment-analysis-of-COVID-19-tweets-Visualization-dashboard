The process is mainly divided into 5 parts:
### 1.Collection of data :  
The tweets are collected from twitter and then made into a csv.Along with that we have fetched real time tweets.  
### 2.Refining of collected data:  
As the tweets collected contain a lot of junk text( for exapmle @,#, emojis), we needed to refine the text.
### 3.Classification of text  
This is where the tweets are classified into positive,negative and neutral.
### 4.Generation of csv  
The results generated from classification are stored in csvs which is used in the web-app.
