#### Sentiment analysis of COVID-19 tweets Visualization dashboard

> Problem Statement: Nowadays there is a huge amount of data available on the internet, especially social media. Monitoring all this data would allow us to gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind different states of affairs. We are living in the middle of a pandemic and people are choosing social media platforms to express their opinions about all the government decisions. There is a need to analyze all this information. Using the analyzed data, the concerned authorities could take further decisions keeping the individualâ€™s opinions in mind. 

> Solution: Sentilyzerr is a web-app which is used to visualize the results of our sentiment analysis model's results. In this app, we focused on building a sentiment analysis model that will analyze all the data related to Covid-19 on Twitter. We created data sets of different behavior of people on the recent decisions of the government. After building the machine learning model we would deploy and save it on the IBM Cloud. This web-app is a user- friendly dashboard to visualize all the analyzed data in the form of graphs so that it can be easily interpreted by the end-user. Our project will be the link between the government, organizations, and the public. The authorities will become more acquainted with how the individuals feel about their choices.

#### The app contains the following features:

Main Dashboard: This main Dashboard is the home page of the web-app. This contains different charts for the results of the sentiment analysis. The charts are interactive and you can remove or the data with a click.

Locolyzer: This page contains different charts for the results of the sentiment analysis done location-wise. We have selected main 4 locations (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata) and we will visualize the results according to the location.

News: Our web-app not only visualizes our analysis' results but also provide the user with the latest updates like confirmed & active cases, recovery & death rate (overall and state-wise), latest tweets (by organizations like WHO, Govt. of India, etc.) and latest news articles by leading NEWS sites.

Feedback Feature: Our web-app has a feedback feature which allows the user to tell about how he/she is feeling about the current situation. This data will be added to our database to increase the data set.

Responsive Design: The app can be viewed on a mobile phone without any problem the elements of the site adjust themselves accordig to the size of the window of the browser.
